# Larva Image Classification Analysis

***

- <p> The purpose of this project was to detect larva from water and the main method we used was the image detection called YOLO. </p>

- As a group of 4 people, we:
   <p>
   - Used GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) to generate similar images. <br/>

   - Used DarkNet and created Bounding Box around larva image. <br/>
   
   - Randomly splitted the full training data into 3 sets(training,testing,validation). <br/>
   
   - Applied methods of YOLO and conducted modeling on training data. </p>
